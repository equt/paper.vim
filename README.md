I'm not happy with the themes I've met so far, so I write one for myself. It's
built with a great toolkit called [vim-colortemplate]. The colorscheme is
generated from the templates in the master branch, and placed in the release
branch. So you would need to change the default branch if you want to try this
theme. For [vim-plug], it would be like

[vim-colortemplate]: https://github.com/lifepillar/vim-colortemplate
[vim-plug]: https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug

```vim
Plug 'theme-suisei/Suisei.vim', { 'branch': 'release' }
```

There are also options provided for hacking, see
[`:h suisei`](https://github.com/theme-suisei/Suisei.vim/blob/release/doc/suisei.txt).
